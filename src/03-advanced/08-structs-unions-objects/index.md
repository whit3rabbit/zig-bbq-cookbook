# Chapter 8: Structs, Unions, and Objects

Learn Zig's approach to structuring data and behavior.

## Topics

- String representation (`format` function for structs)
- Custom string formatting
- Context management (using `defer` and `errdefer`)
- Memory-efficient instances (`packed struct`)
- Encapsulation (`pub` vs private fields)
- Managed attributes (getters/setters pattern)
- Composition vs inheritance
- Extending properties (embedding structs)
- Lazily computed properties
- Simplified initialization
- Interface patterns (vtables vs tagged unions)
- Data models and type systems
- Custom containers (generic structs)
- Delegating attribute access
- Multiple constructors (static factory methods)
- Mixins (`comptime` struct merging)
- State machines (tagged unions for states)
- Visitor pattern
- Managing cyclic data structures (arenas vs reference counting)
- Comparison operations (`compare` or `eql` methods)
