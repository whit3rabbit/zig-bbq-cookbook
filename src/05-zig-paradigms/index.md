# Phase 5: Zig-Specific Paradigms & Projects

This phase explores features and capabilities that make Zig truly unique.

## Chapters

16. **The Zig Build System** - `std.Build` and replacing Make/CMake with native Zig
17. **Advanced Comptime Metaprogramming** - Replacing C macros and C++ templates with type-safe compile-time logic
18. **Explicit Memory Management Patterns** - Zig's unique approach to memory arenas and lack of hidden allocations
19. **WebAssembly and Freestanding Targets** - Running Zig where other languages cannot
20. **High-Performance & Low-Level Networking** - Safer, easier-to-access OS primitives

## Why These Topics Matter

These chapters showcase Zig's philosophy: performance, safety, and simplicity without hidden control flow or allocations.
