# Chapter 19: WebAssembly and Freestanding Targets

Explore Zig's unique ability to target freestanding and WebAssembly environments.

## Topics

- Compiling libraries to WebAssembly (`-target wasm32-freestanding`)
- Exporting functions to JS host environments
- Writing a basic kernel "Hello World" (VGA buffer on `x86-freestanding`)
- Creating UEFI applications
- Minimal ARM embedded blinky LED (interacting with volatile memory registers)

See TODO.md for complete recipe list (5 recipes planned).
