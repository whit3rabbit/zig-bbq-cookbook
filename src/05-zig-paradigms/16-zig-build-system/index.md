# Chapter 16: The Zig Build System

Master Zig's native build system to replace traditional build tools.

## Topics

- Basic build scripts (`zig build run` vs `zig build test`)
- Managing dependencies with `build.zig.zon` (Zig's package manager)
- Cross-compiling projects (using `-Dtarget`)
- Compiling mixed C/C++ and Zig projects (replacing CMake)
- Embedding static assets (`@embedFile` and build steps)
- Creating custom build steps (code generation)
- Conditional compilation (using `builtin` target OS/Arch)

See TODO.md for complete recipe list (7 recipes planned).
