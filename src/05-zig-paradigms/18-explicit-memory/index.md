# Chapter 18: Explicit Memory Management Patterns

Master Zig's explicit memory management philosophy.

## Topics

- Using `GeneralPurposeAllocator` (detecting leaks in debug builds)
- Using `ArenaAllocator` for request-scoped lifecycles
- Implementing fixed-buffer allocators (stack or pre-allocated memory)
- Creating standard library containers with custom allocators
- Handling Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors gracefully
- Implementing reference counting manually (when shared ownership is needed)

See TODO.md for complete recipe list (6 recipes planned).
