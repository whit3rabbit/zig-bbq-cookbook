# Phase 2: Core Recipes

This phase covers the fundamental building blocks of Zig programming.

## Chapters

1. **Data Structures & Algorithms** - Standard library containers, memory management, and slices
2. **Strings and Text** - UTF-8, raw bytes, and text processing with `std.mem` and `std.fmt`
3. **Numbers, Dates, and Times** - Explicit integer types, floats, and `std.time`
4. **Iterators and Generators** - Zig's manual iterator pattern (`next()` returning `?T`)
5. **Files and I/O** - `std.fs`, Readers, Writers, and explicit error handling

## Philosophy

These chapters focus on practical, everyday programming tasks with idiomatic Zig solutions.
